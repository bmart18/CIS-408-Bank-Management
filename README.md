# CIS-434-Bank-Management-System

This semester long project was made for CIS 434 Software Engineering

In this project we aimed to create a Bank Management system that allowed admins to transfer their money, look at profile details, see Transaction History, as well as contact info for staff.

To do this project we used a wide range of languages including PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
To store information in this project a database was used hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
To host the website we used Xampp with Apache.
To test the website for load and bugs we used Apache JMeter.
